Task 0: UTF-8 Validation.
Write a method that determines if a given
data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
* A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long.
* The data set can contain multiple characters.
* The data will be represented by a list of integers.
* Each integer represents 1 byte of data,
    therefore you only need to handle the 8
    least significant bytes of each integer.
